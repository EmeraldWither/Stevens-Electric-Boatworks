# TODO

a) Add proper install instructions
    i) this includes setting up proper ROS tooling, dependencies (providing requirements.txt if on python)
    ii) include setup instructions for the RPI (and maybe arduino)
    iii) wiring instructions for sensors 
    iv) should not include instructions for how to compile the code. Put that in COMPILE.md
